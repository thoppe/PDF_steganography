# PDF Steganography

Hiding information in the font tables. Run `make` to see an example, or view this [document](example.pdf). Try to copy and paste the text to see the steganography in action.

Requires much of the core tex and `pdflatex`, `pf2afm`, `afm2tfm`, `tftopl`, `t1disasm`, `t1asm` to modify fonts.
